Description: This permutation based hypothesis test, suited for several types of data 
    supported by the estimateNetwork function of the bootnet package (Epskamp & Fried, 2018), 
    assesses the difference between two networks based on several invariance measures (network 
    structure invariance, global strength invariance, edge invariance, several centrality 
    measures, etc.). Network structures are estimated with l1-regularization. The Network 
    Comparison Test is suited for comparison of independent (e.g., two different groups) and 
    dependent samples (e.g., one group that is measured twice). See van Borkulo et al. (2021, 
    in press; the final article will be available, upon publication, via its DOI: 
    10.1037/met0000476).
