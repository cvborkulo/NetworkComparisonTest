Changes in version 2.1 (Sacha's fork)
  o Added NCT_bootnet which handles estimateNetwork results. NCT automatically calls NCT_bootnet when used with bootnet objects.
  o Changed EBICglasso estimation to use estimateNetwork. Defaults set in such a way that estimation is identical to previous versions of NetworkComparisonTest (listwise deletion and cor()), but added some arguments also used in estimateNetwork.
  o The 'edges' argument now defaults to a list of all edges.
  o The NCT_cor_auto function has been removed (functionality now implemented in NCT_bootnet)
  o Fixed a bug using edges = "all"
